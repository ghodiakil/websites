Welcome all<br>
My name is<b> Akil ghodi</b><br>
I am student of statistics who completed masters in statistics trying to learn some stuffs of data science.<br>
I give some classes for statistics. To know more about my classes kindly click on the below link.

I can also help you in different projects<br>
Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.<br> 
In other words, it is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data. Also, we can say that statistics is a branch of applied mathematics.<br> 
However, there are two important and basic ideas involved in statistics; they are uncertainty and variation.<br>
The uncertainty and variation in different fields can be determined only through statistical analysis.<br>
These uncertainties are basically determined by the probability that plays an important role in statistics. 
<br>
<h1>Statistics Examples</h1><br>
Some of the real-life examples of statistics are:<br>

To find the mean of the marks obtained by each student in the class whose strength is 50. <br>
The average value here is the statistics of the marks obtained.<br>
Suppose you need to find how many members are employed in a city.
 Since the city is populated with 15 lakh people, hence we will take a survey here for 1000 people (sample). 
Based on that, we will create the data, which is the statistic.<br>

<h1>Basics of Statistics</h1> <br>
The basics of statistics include the measure of central tendency and the measure of dispersion. <br>
 The central tendencies are mean, median and mode and dispersions comprise variance and standard deviation.  <br>

Mean is the average of the observations. Median is the central value when observations are arranged in order. <br>
 The mode determines the most frequent observations in a data set.

Variation is the measure of spread out of the collection of data. Standard deviation is the measure of the dispersion of data from the mean. <br> 
The square of standard deviation is equal to the variance. <br>
<h1>Mathematical Statistics</h1> <br>
Mathematical statistics is the application of Mathematics to Statistics, which was initially conceived as the science of the state 
the collection and analysis of facts about
 a country: its economy, and, military, population, and so forth.

Mathematical techniques used for different analytics include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equation and measure-theoretic probability theory.

<h1>Types of Statistics</h1> <br>
Basically, there are two types of statistics.<br>

Descriptive Statistics<br>
Inferential Statistics<br>
In the case of descriptive statistics, the data or collection of data is described in summary.<br>
 But in the case of inferential stats, it is used to explain the descriptive one. Both these types have been used on large scale.<br>
